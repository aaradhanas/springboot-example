# Spring Boot application
This application uses Spring Boot to develop a REST service for FAQs. The service contains the following functionalities:

- /faq GET all FAQs
- /faq/{id} GET FAQ by id
- /faq POST new FAQ
- /faq/{id} DELETE FAQ by id

## TODO

- For now, the data is stored in a local variable. This should be enhanced to store in DB.
- Enforce authentication mechanisms.
- Understand different Spring boot annotations.
